    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> 
        My name is <em>Jing Li</em>. I am from Shanghai, China. I graduated from <abbr title="Shanghai Normal Universi">SHNU</abbr>. I have been working for over 10 years as a travel consultant before I moved to Canada. After coming to Canada, I continued to work in a travel agency. But unfortunately,I lost my job during Covid.

    <p>
        I really like what Einstein said, we cannot stop moving forward. Even if you encounter difficulties, keep looking forward. So I chose to come to Algonquin College to study again in the 40<sup>th</sup> year of my life. I want to learn something about web design,video design.  So I choose the program of Interactive Media Design. I think learning this program can enrich my career options in the future.
